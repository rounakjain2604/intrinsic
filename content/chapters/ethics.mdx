## Overview

Ethics isn't just the first topic in the CFA curriculum — it's the one topic that shows up at every level, and the one that can make or break a borderline pass. The CFA Institute takes it seriously enough that your ethics score is used as a tiebreaker if you're near the minimum passing score.

This chapter covers the **Code of Ethics**, the **Standards of Professional Conduct**, and how they apply in real-world scenarios that the exam loves to test. Think of it as learning the rules of the game before you play.

## Key Concepts

### 1. The Code of Ethics

The Code is a set of six broad principles that every CFA charterholder and candidate agrees to uphold. You don't need to memorize them word-for-word, but you need to understand the *spirit* behind them:

- Act with **integrity, competence, diligence, respect, and in an ethical manner**
- Place the **integrity of the profession** and **clients' interests** above your own
- Use **reasonable care** and exercise **independent professional judgment**
- Practice and encourage others to practice in a **professional and ethical manner**
- Promote the integrity and viability of **global capital markets**
- Maintain and improve your **professional competence**

<Callout type="exam-tip">
The exam rarely asks you to recite the Code directly. Instead, it presents scenarios where you need to identify which principle is being violated. Focus on understanding the intent behind each principle.

### 2. Standards of Professional Conduct

The Standards are the detailed rules that flow from the Code. There are seven major standards, each with sub-sections. Here's the high-level map:

| Standard | Focus |
|---|---|
| **I. Professionalism** | Knowledge of the law, independence, misrepresentation, misconduct |
| **II. Integrity of Capital Markets** | Material nonpublic info (MNPI), market manipulation |
| **III. Duties to Clients** | Loyalty, fair dealing, suitability, confidentiality |
| **IV. Duties to Employers** | Loyalty, additional compensation, responsibilities of supervisors |
| **V. Investment Analysis** | Diligence, communication, record retention |
| **VI. Conflicts of Interest** | Disclosure, priority of transactions, referral fees |
| **VII. CFA Institute** | Conduct as participants, reference to CFA designation |

<Callout type="key-concept">
Standard III (Duties to Clients) is the most heavily tested area. Pay special attention to the difference between **suitability** (matching investments to client needs) and **fair dealing** (treating all clients equitably, not equally).
</Callout>

### 3. Material Nonpublic Information (MNPI)

One of the exam's favorite ethical dilemmas. **Material** information is anything a reasonable investor would consider important in making an investment decision. **Nonpublic** means it hasn't been disseminated to the market through proper channels.

The mosaic theory is your defense: you *can* combine multiple pieces of public and non-material nonpublic information to form a conclusion. That's research, not insider trading. But if any single piece of your analysis is both material *and* nonpublic — you can't trade on it.

<Callout type="warning">
If a CEO tells you at a dinner party that earnings will miss estimates by 30% — that's MNPI. You cannot trade, recommend, or communicate this information. The correct action is to encourage the company to make the information public.
</Callout>

## Formulas

<FormulaBlock label="Ethics Decision Framework">
1. Identify the relevant facts and stakeholders

2. Determine what ethical and legal obligations apply

3. Consider the impact on all parties involved

4. Make a decision and act — document your reasoning

5. Reflect: would you be comfortable if your decision were made public?
</FormulaBlock>

<FormulaBlock label="MNPI Test">
Is the information **material**? → Would a reasonable investor consider it important?

Is the information **nonpublic**? → Has it been broadly disseminated?

If BOTH are true → **Do not trade, recommend, or communicate**

If only one is true → **Mosaic theory may apply** — proceed with caution
</FormulaBlock>

## The Firewall Rule

Investment firms maintain **information barriers** (sometimes called "Chinese walls") to prevent the flow of MNPI between departments. For example, the investment banking team may have material information about a client's upcoming merger — the research and trading teams must not have access to this information.

As a CFA candidate, the key takeaway is:
- If you *accidentally* receive MNPI, immediately notify your compliance department
- Do not trade on the information or share it with others
- Document the incident

## Practice Questions

These questions test your ability to apply the Standards in realistic scenarios — exactly how the CFA exam works.

**Question 1:** Sarah, a portfolio manager, learns from her brother (a CEO) that his company will announce a stock split next week. She does not trade but tells her best client about the upcoming split. Has Sarah violated any Standards?

**Answer:** Yes. Sarah has violated **Standard II(A) — Material Nonpublic Information**. Even though she didn't trade herself, she communicated MNPI to her client. The stock split is material (a reasonable investor would want to know), and it's nonpublic (not yet announced).

**Question 2:** Marcus, an analyst, combines five pieces of publicly available information about a pharmaceutical company's drug trial to conclude the results will be positive. He recommends the stock before the results are announced. Has he violated any Standards?

**Answer:** No. This is an example of the **mosaic theory** in action. Each piece of information is public or non-material on its own. Marcus has used diligent research to form a conclusion — this is exactly what analysts are supposed to do.
