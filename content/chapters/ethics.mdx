## Overview

Let's get one thing straight right out of the gate: ethics isn't just a box to check on your way to earning your charter. It is the absolute bedrock of the investment profession. We operate in an industry where the product we sell is entirely invisible. We sell trust. When trust evaporates, the markets seize up, capital stops flowing to the right places, and the global economy grinds to a halt. The rules you are about to learn exist to protect that incredibly fragile ecosystem.

From an exam perspective, this chapter is your best friend and your worst enemy. It makes up a massive chunk of your score, and the graders love to test you in the gray areas. You aren't going to see questions where a cartoon villain steals money from a pensioner; you are going to see smart, well-intentioned professionals accidentally crossing the line because they didn't fundamentally understand the boundaries of their duties.

My goal here isn't to read you a legal dictionary. We are going to break down these concepts so you understand the *why* behind the rules. If you grasp the underlying logic — that the client always comes first, and the integrity of the market comes before even the client — you can navigate any tricky scenario the exam throws your way.

<Callout type="exam-tip">
The exam almost never tests definitions. It tests application. When you read a scenario, ignore the job titles and dollar amounts — focus only on who had a duty to whom, and whether that duty was honored. In most Ethics questions, the answer hinges on identifying a subtle violation that a well-intentioned professional committed by accident. If you find yourself debating between two answers, pick the one that protects the market or client at the cost of personal benefit. That choice is almost always correct.

### The Six Core Principles

Before we get into the granular rules, you need to understand the six high-level philosophical principles that govern our profession. Think of these as the constitution of your career:

1. **Integrity and Respect:** You are expected to behave honestly, diligently, and respectfully with everyone you encounter in the financial markets, from your largest clients to your colleagues and competitors.
2. **The Hierarchy of Interests:** Your own personal interests always take a backseat to the well-being of your clients, and your client's interests take a backseat to the overarching reputation of the investment industry.
3. **Independent Judgment:** When analyzing assets or making recommendations, you must exercise careful, unbiased judgment without letting outside influences, kickbacks, or corporate pressure sway your conclusions.
4. **Ethical Leadership:** It is not enough to simply keep your own hands clean; you must actively foster a culture of professionalism and high ethical standards among your peers and subordinates.
5. **Market Protection:** You have a fundamental duty to uphold the transparency, safety, and functionality of the global capital markets because society at large relies on them.
6. **Continuous Learning:** The financial world moves at lightning speed, so you have a professional obligation to keep your skills sharp and help other practitioners do the same.

### The 7 Standards of Professional Conduct: A Cheat Sheet

The principles above are operationalized into seven concrete standards. Here is your quick-reference map to how they work in the real world.

| Standard | What it means in plain English |
| :--- | :--- |
| **I. Professionalism** | Know the rules, stay independent, don't lie, and don't do anything in your personal or professional life that makes the industry look bad. |
| **II. Integrity of Capital Markets** | Keep the markets fair by never trading on secret, market-moving information or artificially manipulating asset prices. |
| **III. Duties to Clients** | Treat everyone fairly, keep client secrets locked down, ensure your advice actually fits their specific needs, and present your track record honestly. |
| **IV. Duties to Employers** | Be loyal to the firm paying your salary, don't steal their intellectual property, don't take side gigs without permission, and supervise your team effectively. |
| **V. Investment Analysis and Recommendations** | Do your homework before recommending an asset, keep immaculate records, and communicate clearly about the risks and limits of your advice. |
| **VI. Conflicts of Interest** | Tell the truth about any biases, kickbacks, or personal trades that could cloud your judgment so your clients and employer can decide for themselves. |
| **VII. Responsibilities as a Candidate/Member** | Don't cheat on the exams, and don't exaggerate what passing the exams actually proves about your abilities. |

### How Valuation Connects to Ethics

Ethics governs how you *apply* valuation models, communicate findings, and handle the material information those models produce. The discounted cash flow framework below is a core tool in equity analysis — and nearly every ethical violation in equity research traces back to mishandling the data that feeds into it.

## Deep Dive: Standard II (Integrity of Capital Markets)

When you strip away all the jargon, Standard II is about keeping the playing field level. If investors believe the game is rigged, they take their money and go home.

### The Prohibition on MNPI

The most critical part of this standard is the ban on using **material nonpublic information** (MNPI). If you know a secret that will move a stock's price, you cannot trade on it, and you cannot whisper it to your buddy so they can trade on it. It doesn't matter if you stumbled upon the information accidentally or if a CEO handed it to you on a silver platter. If you have MNPI, your hands are tied until that information hits the broad market.

<FormulaBlock label="MNPI Decision Framework">
Step 1 — Identify the information: What exactly do you know, and where did it come from?

Step 2 — Test for materiality: Would a reasonable investor consider this important? Would it likely move the asset's price?

Step 3 — Test for public status: Has this been broadly disseminated through official channels (press release, regulatory filing, public conference call)?

Step 4 — Apply the verdict: If BOTH material AND nonpublic → stop immediately. Do not trade. Do not communicate. Notify your compliance department.

Step 5 — Consider mosaic theory: If the information is nonpublic but non-material on its own, ask whether it can be legally combined with other public data as part of legitimate research.
</FormulaBlock>

### The Two-Question Test for MNPI

How do you know if the juicy gossip you just heard is actually MNPI? You run it through a simple, two-question gauntlet:

1. **Is it material?** Ask yourself: *Would a reasonable investor care about this?* If the news is released, will the asset's price move? A CEO stepping down due to a massive accounting fraud is highly material. The CEO switching from regular coffee to decaf is not. The source matters here too. A random blogger guessing about a merger isn't material; the CFO confirming that same merger absolutely is.
2. **Is it nonpublic?** Has this information been blasted out to the general investing public? A press release, a regulatory filing, or a public conference call means the data is public. A private dinner with the board of directors, or a closed-door meeting with top shareholders, means the data is strictly nonpublic.

If the answer to *both* questions is yes, you are radioactive. Do not trade.

### The Mosaic Theory

Now, you might be thinking: *Isn't my job as an analyst to figure out things the market doesn't know yet?* Yes, it is! And that is where the **mosaic theory** comes in to save the day.

Think of mosaic theory like putting together a massive jigsaw puzzle. You are allowed to gather dozens of pieces of public information (like earnings reports and macro data) and combine them with pieces of *non-material* nonpublic information (like chatting with a supplier about how busy their factory floor is). On their own, none of these pieces violate the rules. But when you, the genius analyst, assemble them, you might form a highly material conclusion — like realizing a company is about to miss its quarterly earnings target.

Trading on that conclusion is perfectly legal. In fact, it's the exact type of deep, investigative research the financial system wants to encourage.

<Callout type="key-concept">
The mosaic theory protects you when each individual piece of nonpublic information you gather is non-material on its own. The moment you receive a single piece that is both material AND nonpublic — even as part of broader research — the entire trade is off the table. The test is per piece of information, not per conclusion. Your genius synthesis can be material; the raw ingredients cannot be.
</Callout>

### Market Manipulation

Standard II also strictly forbids market manipulation. You cannot mess with the price-setting mechanism of an asset. This comes in two flavors:

- **Information-based manipulation:** Spreading fake rumors on message boards to artificially pump up a stock before you dump it.
- **Transaction-based manipulation:** Executing trades solely to create the illusion of liquidity or volume, like buying and selling the same asset between two accounts you control (wash trading) just to make the market think something exciting is happening.

## Deep Dive: Standard III (Duties to Clients)

Your clients are the reason you have a job. Standard III is all about respecting the profound power imbalance between you (the financial expert) and them (the people trusting you with their life savings).

### Suitability

You cannot recommend an asset simply because it's a "good investment." It has to be a good investment *for that specific client*. This is the concept of **suitability**. Before you deploy a single dollar, you must deeply understand your client's risk tolerance, return requirements, liquidity needs, and time horizon.

If a 25-year-old tech entrepreneur wants to put 5% of her portfolio into high-risk venture capital, that might be highly suitable. If an 85-year-old retiree living on a fixed income asks for that exact same investment, it is likely wildly unsuitable. You also have to look at the total portfolio. A highly volatile biotech stock might seem insanely risky on its own, but if it represents 0.5% of a massive, globally diversified portfolio, it might actually fit perfectly.

### Fair Dealing (Not Equal Treatment)

You must deal fairly and objectively with all of your clients. Notice the phrasing: *fairly*, not *equally*.

Why not equally? Because equal is practically impossible. If you change your rating on a stock from a "Hold" to a "Sell," you can't simultaneously dial the phone numbers of all 300 of your clients. Furthermore, it is completely acceptable to offer a premium, higher-fee tier of service where clients get more face-time with you.

What you *cannot* do is disadvantage one group of clients to help another. When you have a hot IPO, you must allocate the shares on a pro-rata basis to all suitable clients. You cannot stuff the best investments into the accounts of your highest-paying clients, and you certainly cannot put them into your own personal account first.

### Confidentiality

Your clients will tell you highly sensitive things: how much money they have, their health issues, their divorce proceedings, and their estate plans. You must keep this information locked down. There are only three exceptions to the rule of confidentiality:

1. The client is engaged in illegal activities.
2. The law explicitly requires you to disclose the information (like a subpoena).
3. The client gives you clear permission to share it.

If your buddy asks how his brother's retirement account is doing, your answer should be silence.

<Callout type="warning">
A common exam trap: a client mentions their upcoming divorce while reviewing their estate plan. Later, a colleague asks why the client is making large withdrawals. Saying anything — even "they're going through some personal stuff" — is a confidentiality breach. The only correct answer is silence and a referral to your compliance department. The exam will try to make the disclosure seem harmless or even kind. Don't fall for it.

## The CLEAR Framework for Ethical Decisions

When you face a gray area in the real world or on the exam, you need a system to cut through the noise. Use the CLEAR Framework to identify exactly what your duty is.

<FormulaBlock label="The CLEAR Decision Framework">
C — Clarify the Conflict: Strip away the emotions. Who are the actual stakeholders? What is the core tension? Is it a clash between your bonus and your client's returns? Is it loyalty to your boss versus the integrity of the market?

L — List the Obligations: Remember the hierarchy. Market integrity is always number one. Your client is number two. Your employer is number three. You are dead last.

E — Evaluate the Options: Play out the tape. If you take Action A, who gets hurt? Does Action B resolve the conflict, or does it just hide it until it blows up later?

A — Act with Transparency: Sunlight is the best disinfectant. If you have a conflict of interest, eliminate it where possible. If you cannot eliminate it, disclose it in plain, obvious language so the client can evaluate your motives themselves.

R — Review the Outcome: Did your action ultimately protect the client and the market? If the answer is no, you chose the wrong path — go back to step E and reconsider.

## Scenario-Based Practice Questions

Let's put this into practice. Here are 5 original scenarios testing the concepts we just covered.

**Question 1**

Marcus is a portfolio manager for a wealth management firm. He receives an allocation of a highly anticipated, oversubscribed tech IPO. Marcus knows the stock will likely pop on the first day of trading. He allocates 80% of the shares to his three largest institutional clients, who generate the most revenue for his firm, and allocates the remaining 20% to his retail clients. Did Marcus violate any ethical standards?

**Answer:** Yes. Marcus violated the standard regarding Fair Dealing. While he is allowed to offer different tiers of service, he is strictly prohibited from disadvantaging some clients to benefit others on investment actions. Oversubscribed IPOs must be allocated on a pro-rata basis to all clients for whom the investment is suitable. By playing favorites with his top revenue generators, he treated his retail clients unfairly.

---

**Question 2**

Elena is a retail analyst. She reads a public regulatory filing showing that Neon Dynamics is increasing its raw material purchases. She then visits several of Neon's retail stores and observes that foot traffic is incredibly heavy. Finally, she chats with a store manager who mentions, "We are selling out of our newest product every single day." Elena combines these pieces of information and issues a "Strong Buy" recommendation, concluding the company will shatter its next earnings estimate. Has Elena traded on Material Nonpublic Information?

**Answer:** No. Elena has perfectly executed the mosaic theory. She combined public data (regulatory filings) with non-material nonpublic data (a store manager's casual observation about local inventory). While her *conclusion* is highly material, the individual pieces of nonpublic data she used were not material on their own. This is excellent analytical work, not insider trading.

**Question 3**

David manages a fixed-income portfolio for a conservative pension fund. The fund's mandate restricts investments to investment-grade corporate bonds. David's compensation is tied to beating a specific yield benchmark. To boost the portfolio's yield and secure his bonus, David allocates 10% of the portfolio to high-yield, speculative-grade debt instruments. When questioned by the client, David argues that the risk is mitigated because the high-yield bonds are perfectly negatively correlated with another asset in the portfolio. Did David violate any standards?

**Answer:** Yes. David violated the standard regarding Suitability and Loyalty, Prudence, and Care. Regardless of the portfolio-level correlation argument, David explicitly ignored the strict investment mandate set by the client. Furthermore, his motivation was driven by his personal desire to hit a bonus hurdle, putting his own interests ahead of the client's stated constraints.

**Question 4**

Sarah manages money for a prominent local celebrity. At a charity gala, the director of a local non-profit approaches Sarah and says, "We are hoping to get a massive donation from your celebrity client for our new hospital wing. I know she just sold her software company. Can you give me a ballpark of how much liquid cash she has right now?" Sarah replies, "I can't give you an exact number, but I can confirm her liquidity event was north of $10 million." Did Sarah violate any standards?

**Answer:** Yes. Sarah blatantly violated the standard regarding Preservation of Confidentiality. A client's wealth, account balances, and liquidity are highly sensitive. Unless the client is committing a crime, a court orders disclosure, or the client explicitly gave Sarah permission to share the information with the charity, Sarah must keep her mouth shut. Providing a "ballpark figure" is still a full confidentiality breach.

---

**Question 5**

Jason owns a large position in a micro-cap mining company with very low daily trading volume. He wants to exit his position, but knows selling all at once will crush the stock price. To prevent this, Jason posts a detailed, fabricated story on an anonymous trading forum claiming the company has just struck a massive, undisclosed gold vein. As retail investors flood in and drive the price up, Jason slowly sells off his entire position into the newly created liquidity. Did Jason violate the rules?

**Answer:** Yes. Jason severely violated the standard regarding Market Manipulation — specifically, information-based manipulation. By spreading maliciously false rumors with the direct intent of deceiving market participants and artificially inflating the stock's price and volume, Jason damaged the integrity of the capital markets solely for his own personal exit strategy.

## Visual Reference: Yield Curves and Bond Pricing

Understanding how interest rates move — and how fixed income securities respond — is foundational context for fair dealing and suitability decisions in fixed income portfolios.
